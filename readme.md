# Email Spam Classification

![logo](./demo.png)

This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting spam emails using Natural Language Processing techniques and Semi-supervised learning, such as Label Propagation, Label Spreading and Self-Learning. The goal is to create an effective and efficient spam detection system that can classify emails as spam or non-spam with high accuracy.

## Setup

1. Create and activate your virtual environment.

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi scikit-learn uvicorn imbalanced-learn nltk
   ```

## Getting Started

To test this spam detection model, follow these steps:

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn spam_detection_api:app --reload --port 8001
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:5173` with your browser to see the result.

4. You are all set ðŸŽ‰
